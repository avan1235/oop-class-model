# MIM UW Bank Java Model

Create a model of Bank with its clients and play with it in `Main` class.

You need to satisfy all `TODO` fields in code that can be placed in exceptions (to be removed)
or in some comments (also remove after implementing) - you can find all of them with `Ctrl+Alt+L`
shortcut in Intellij.

Probably it would be easier to start with `BankAction`, then work on `BankClient` and finally work on
`Bank` and short example in `Main`
